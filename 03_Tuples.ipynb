    "# Tuples \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python tuples are very similar to lists, however, unlike lists they are immutable meaning they can not be changed. You would use tuples to present things that shouldn't be changed, such as days of the week, or dates on a calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will get a brief overview of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Constructing Tuples\n",
    "2.) Basic Tuple Methods\n",
    "3.) Immutability\n",
    "4.) When to Use Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing Tuples\n",
    "The construction of a tuples use () with elements separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use Tuples\n",
    "You may be wondering, \"Why bother using tuples when they have fewer available methods?\" To be honest, tuples are not used as often as lists in programming, but are used when immutability is necessary. If in your program you are passing around an object and need to make sure it does not get changed, then a tuple becomes your solution. It provides a convenient source of data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to create and use tuples in your programming as well as have an understanding of their immutability.\n",
